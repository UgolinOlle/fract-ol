## üíª Description

Fract-ol is a graphical project that explores fractals, mathematical sets that exhibit a repeating pattern displayed at every scale. This project allows users to visualize and interact with various fractals in real-time.

## ‚å®Ô∏è Usage

### Prerequisites

Before running the program, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- [MinilibX](https://github.com/42Paris/minilibx-linux) - A simple X-Window (X11R6) programming API in C, needed for graphics.

### Compilation

To compile the Fract-ol program, use the provided Makefile:

```bash
make
make bonus
```

### Execution

Run the program with the desired fractal type as an argument:

```bash
./fractol [fractal name] [option]
./fractol julia [1 | 2 | 3]
```

Supported fractal types:

- Mandelbrot
- Julia
- Tricorn

### Controls

- Arrow keys: Move around the fractal
- Scroll wheel: Zoom in and out
- AWSD: Change Julia iteration
